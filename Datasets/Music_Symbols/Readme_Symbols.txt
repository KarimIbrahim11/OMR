The Music Symbols dataset consists in music clefs and accidentals. They are extracted from modern and old music scores (from the 19th century).

In case you use this database in your publications, you should include in your acknowledgements section something like "We acknowledge the Document Analysis Group of the Computer Vision Center for creating this data set". 

In addition, please add this reference, in which the database is presented:

Liu, W. and Lladós, J. and Ogier, J.M. editors, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 5046, Pages 51-60, Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, 2008.

Thanks a lot,
